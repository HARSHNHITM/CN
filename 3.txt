Aim: - To perform an experiment using WIRESHARK to understand the
operation of TCP/IP layers.

System Software: -Wireshark,Ubuntu System

Theory/ Working Principle:

WIRESHARK is a network packet analyzer . A network packet
analyzer presents captured packet data in as much data as possible.
Here are some reasons people use Wireshark:
1. Network Administrators use it to troubleshoot network problems
2. Network security engineers use it to examine security problems
3. QA engineers use it to veriâ€ y network applications
4. Developers use it to debug protocol implementations
5. People use it to learn network protocol internals
Analyzing Data Packets on Wireshark
Wireshark shows you three different panes for inspecting packet data. The Packet
List, the top pane, is a list of all the packets in the capture. When you click on a
packet, the other two panes change to show you the details about the selected
packet. You can also tell if the packet is part of a conversation.
Wireshark Capture Filters

Capture filters limit the captured packets by the filter. Meaning if the packets don't
match
the filter, Wireshark won't save them. Here are some examples of capture filters:
host IP-address: this filter limits the capture to traffic to and from the IP address net
192.168.0.0/24: this filter captures all traffic on the subnet.
dst host IP-address: capture packets sent to the
specified host. port 53: capture traffic on port
53 only.
