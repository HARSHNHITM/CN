Title: SSh Using Packet Tracer

Aim: - SSh Using Packet Tracer

System Software: -Cisco Packet Tracer

Theory/ Working Principle:

SSH(Secure Shell) is an access credential that is used in the SSH Protocol. In
other words, it is a cryptographic network protocol that is used for transferring
encrypted data over the network. It allows you to connect to a server, or
multiple servers, without having you to remember or enter your password for
each system that is to login remotely from one system into another.

It always comes in key pair:

1. Public key – Everyone can see it, no need to protect it. (for encryption
function)
2. Private key – Stays in computer, must be protected. (for decryption
function)

Key pairs can be of the following types:

1. User Key – If public key and private key remain with the user.
2. Host Key – If the public key and private key are on a remote system.
3. Session key – Used when a large amount of data is to be transmitted.

How SSH Works ?
It uses asymmetric cipher for performing encryption and decryption. There are
many encryption methods:

rsa, dsa, ed25519 etc.

SSH is key based authentication that is not prone to brute-force attack.
It is more convenient and secure than login ids and passwords .There is no
exposure of valid credentials, if a server has been compromised.



Commands

configure terminal
hostname R1
interface g0/0
ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 
end

3) Select PC open command prompt. Enter following command 
ping 192.168.1.1
