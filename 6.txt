Title: Configure OSPF using packet Tracer

Aim: - Configure OSPF using packet Tracer

System Software: - Cisco Packet Tracer software

Theory/ Working Principle:
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol that is used to
find the best path between the source and the destination router using its own
Shortest Path First). OSPF is developed by Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) as one of the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), i.e, the protocol which aims
at moving the packet within a large autonomous system or routing domain. It is
a network layer protocol which works on protocol number 89 and uses AD value
110. OSPF uses multicast address 224.0.0.5 for normal communication and
224.0.0.6 for update to designated router(DR)/Backup Designated Router
(BDR).
