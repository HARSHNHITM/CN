Aim: - Design VPN and configure RIP using packet Tracer

System Software: - Cisco Packet Tracer software

Theory/ Working Principle:


Routing Information Protocol (RIP) protocol is the intradomain (interior) routing
protocol which is based on distance vector routing and it is used inside an
autonomous system.Routers and network links are called nodes. The first
column of the routing table is the destination address. The cost metric in this
protocol is hop count which is the number of networks which need to be passed
to reach a destination. Here infinity is defined by a fixed number which is 16; it
means that using a Rip network cannot have more than 15 hops. RIP Version-1:
It is an open standard protocol.It is a classful routing protocol. Updates are
broadcasted. Its administrative distance value is 120, it means it is not reliable,
The lesser the administrative distance value the reliability is much more. Its
metric is hop count and max hop count is 15. There will be a total of 16 routers
in the network. When there will be the same number of hop to reach the
destination, Rip starts to perform load balancing. Load balancing means if
there are three ways to reach the destination and each way has the same number of
routers then packets will be sent to each path to reach the destination. This
reduces traffic and also the load is balanced. It is used in small companies, in
this protocol routing tables are updated in each 30 sec. Whenever a link breaks,
the rip traces out another path to reach the destination. It is one of the slowest
protocols.
